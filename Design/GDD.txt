Planet Hopper Game Design Document
__________________________________
-------
Concept
-------
- The player must jump from planet to planet as long as they can
- You will score points for every consecutive planet you jump on
- Planets will fly at you at different speeds
- Game will be an endless platformer style

-----
Rules
-----
- You can only move left, right, up and down
- Each planet gives you +1 points
- You lose the game if you hit the bottom or right border of screen

------------
Requirements
------------
- SFX: Jumping, dying, maybe planets whooshing
- Static Mesh: Robot (from Epic store)
- Textures/Materials: 
  - Use Moon / Mars materials that I made in test project
  - Will generate randomly sized spheres with the mars or moon material
    - Make sure that we either alter a material instance with code 
    - OR
    - Have sufficient material instances for planet variability
- Music: Background sci-fi music
- UI: 
  - Main menu, pause menu overlay, game over
  - High Score (need to somehow save state)
